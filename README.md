 ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! Iâ€™m Kabelo Mabula â€” part-time software developer, part-time code whisperer, and full-time coffee enthusiast. I write code that (usually) works and debug like a detective solving a digital mystery.  <br />

By day, I build clean, scalable software. By nightâ€¦ well, I still build software (because bugs donâ€™t sleep). With a background in computer science and a passion for fintech, Iâ€™m on a mission to make financial systems smarter, faster, and a little less boring.  <br />

I speak fluent JavaScript, C#, and sarcasm. I believe in clean code, strong coffee, and shipping features that donâ€™t break everything (just some things).  <br />

ðŸ“« Got an idea, a project? Letâ€™s chat â€” I promise Iâ€™m more fun than a failing deployment.  <br />

ðŸš€ Happy coding, and may your commits always be clean!
